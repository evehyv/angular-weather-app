# Angular Weather App

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.1.

The application can be used to search information about weather conditions for a specific city. [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) is used to fetch the data. If you clone this project, make sure to replace the `API_KEY` string in [weather.component.ts](src/app/weather/weather.component.ts) with your own API key.
